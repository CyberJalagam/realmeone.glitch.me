      About This Project
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left:5%; margin-top:3%; margin-right:5%; font-family:Quicksand; font-size: 22px">
      This is a free and open-source project hosted on <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank">Glitch</a>.
      This project was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/thepriyamkalra" target="_blank">Priyam Kalra</a> in his free time.
      And it was later modified by me along with a completely new web-design under the name <a href="https://realmeone.glitch.me" target="_blank">realmeone</a>.<br><br>
      This project fetches latest releases of custom roms, recoveries and kernels from <a href="https://telegram.me/Realme1Updates" target="_blank">@Realme1Updates</a>, the official Telegram Channel for Realme 1,
      and updates them on this website. The amazing part is that it's fully automatic!<br><br>
      The sole aim of this project is to help out the users of Realme 1 to easily find and download custom firmware for their device, needless to say,
      we have no intention of earning revenue from this project/website. All permissions were taken from the creator of the <a href="https://github.com/thepriyamkalra/curtana.glitch.me" target="_blank"
      >original project</a> and developers of custom firmware.<br><br>
      Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/shashwat2003" target="_blank">Shashwat</a> for his codes, <a href="https://cyberjalagam.github.io" target="_blank">Jaishnav</a> for hosting this project and,
      of course <a href="https://github.com/thepriyamkalra" target="_blank">Priyam Kalra</a>!<br><br><br>
